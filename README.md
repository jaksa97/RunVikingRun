# RunVikingRun

This is a simple Endless Run game made in Unity. All assets(prefab and backgrounds) are taken from the assets store and they are free.

## Project description

In this game your main goal is to collect as many points as possible by avoiding obstacles(enemies). Obstacles are created according to pattern 2/3(spawning in 2 of 3 tracks), 
you avoid them by moving up and down with the arrow keys(up and down in order). At the beginning of each game you have five lives and in every collision with an obstacle you lose 1 life. When you lose all lives a GameOver scene appears which gives you the ability to start a new game using the R key.
